# Deforestation Mapping
A UNet-based machine learning algorithm which maps deforestation using Sentinel-2 Level 2A multi-spectral images.

This repository contains the scripts referring to a methodology that performs the deforestation mapping using UNets and satellite images from Sentinel-2. The methodology was tested for mapping deforestation spots using images from the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes, located in Brazil.

## Example Usage
To identify deforestation in areas where UNet has already been trained (Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest), it is possible to directly use the scripts presented in the **deforestation-mapping** folder. Otherwise, it is necessary to carry out a new training using the training files of UNet.

### Training the UNet
