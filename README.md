# Deforestation Mapping
A UNet-based machine learning algorithm which maps deforestation using Sentinel-2 Level 2A multi-spectral images.

This repository contains the scripts referring to a methodology that performs the deforestation mapping using UNets and satellite images from Sentinel-2. The methodology was tested for mapping deforestation spots using images from the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes, located in Brazil.
